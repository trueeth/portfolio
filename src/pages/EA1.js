          The client for this application approached me because they were looking to create a
          product that allows drivers to quickly connect with mechanics when dealing with car
          problems. They also were loooking to enable hobbyist and mechanics unassociated with any
          particular shop the opportunity to gig-work and manage their own time.
          <br /> <br /> I was able to effectively create user personas, competitive audits,
          sketches, wireframes and a final prototype and send over final assets to an engineer in
          around three months.

          I chose to create user personas first, as I wanted a high level understanding of some of
          the reasons different users would use the app as well as some of the hestitations that
          could prevent a user from using ours. <br /> <br /> To ensure inclusivity and edge case
          users, I created many user personas to represent all of the different user groups that
          this app will be targeting. A few of the key areas included were: diversity in age groups,
          potential disabilities, exposure to technology, experience with car engines, as well as
          distance from major cities.

          Following Personas, I decided to do a competitive audit on the similar B2C products in the
          market. To get the most useful insights, I decided to only focus on applications that were
          directly available to a broad market, which removes applications like State farm roadside
          assistance or any other insurance-associated service provider. <br /> <br /> I
          specifically chose Angi, because they have a unique gig-work structure that would help me
          to understand common design standards that allow service providers to showcase their
          services and get connected with customers. Uber felt like an obvious choice as they handle
          complicated location tracking and connect drivers and riders in a similar way that we will
          connect service providers and requesters.Lastly, I chose to audit verizon media
          assistance, because I wanted to have a roadside assistance specific company to research.

          After some feedback and reviews, I went back through each of the views to update the UI to
          reflect the visual design and look at feel that the client wanted to go with.

              The biggest challenge with this appication was the ambiguity of the requirements. I'm
              used to working with clients who are highly opinionated, but this client was truly
              open to anything. This made it tricky to get an established sense of which direction
              the application should go in. This ended up being a great personal challenge, as I was
              able to add more input in the direction of the product and company as a whole which
              challenged the way I approach design thinking.
